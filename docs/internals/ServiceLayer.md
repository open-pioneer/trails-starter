# Service Layer

This document contains details about the implementation of the Open Pioneer Trails runtime's service layer.
It should aid developers to gain an understanding of the implementation in order to maintain or extend it.

The service layer provides a generic dependency injection mechanism in which services can be defined.
Services may reference each other through references, forming a graph of services.

See [Design](./Design.md) for some background information.

## Overview

The service layer's implementation lives in the package `@open-pioneer/runtime`, mostly in the `services` directory.
It is heavily inspired by the Spring framework.

The most important classes and modules are:

- `class ServiceLayer`

    Responsible for maintaining the service lifecycle.
    This involves starting all required services, connecting them via references and destroying them again when the system shuts down.

- `function verifyDependencies`

    The service layer will verify the services' dependency graph before starting them by calling this function.
    It will visit all services to ensure that their dependencies can be fulfilled and that no cycles occur.
    On error, the method will output sensible error messages that can be easily understood by the developer.

    In its current form, the function essentially ensures that the dependency graph is an acyclic graph.

    The return value of `verifyDependencies` is used by the service layer.
    It contains the service index (mapping interface names, qualifiers etc. to services) and the
    verified dependency information (mapping services to other referenced services).
    The service layer will use the index to support dynamic service lookups (e.g. for the UI)
    and the dependency information during service construction to setup service references.

- `class PackageRepr` / `ServiceRepr`

    Represents a package / service at runtime.
    It must be noted that these classes are stateful: their state will reflect the changes made by the service layer.
    For example, a `ServiceRepr`'s `instance` attribute will hold the actual service instance once it has been created.
    As a consequence, they cannot be reused or shared between multiple application instances.

- `function createPackages`

    Parses metadata into instances of `PackageRepr` and `ServiceRepr`.
    This transforms the well defined metadata format (input to the service layer) into the internal runtime representation.
    Package properties are also handled here: properties defined by the application are merged with the default values declared in
    the individual packages.

## Metadata format

The metadata format is currently maintained in the runtime package at `@open-pioneer/runtime/metadata`.
It describes packages, services and their associated metadata (such as references, provided interfaces, etc.).
In most instances, the metadata will be autogenerated by build tools.
However, it can also be provided manually (see tests).

The metadata format should be stable: it is part of the public interface.
When the metadata format is altered, the build tooling will (most likely) have to be updated as well.

## Service Layer Lifecycle

1. _Construction_

    The service layer is constructed from a set of `PackageRepr`.
    It will immediately verify and index the services in the dependency graph.
    The construction is currently triggered from the custom element class when it is connected to the DOM.

    During its construction, the service layer will first verify the entire service graph (needed _and_ unneeded services).
    It will then compute the set of actually required services.
    This set is currently made up of the services required by the UI (taking from package metadata) and the services required
    by the framework (constructor parameter).
    Only those services (and their transitive dependencies) will actually be started.

2. _start_

    The `start()` method is called to launch all required services.

    `createService` is recursive: a service's dependencies must be created before the service itself can be created.

    The process to construct a service `s` is as follows:

    1. Has `s` already been constructed? Return `s.instance` and increment its reference count.
    2. Is the service in any other state than `not-constructed`? Throw an error (this is a sanity check, since `verifyDependency` should have caught the issue).
    3. Call `createService(d)` for every service `d` required by `s` and store the instance reference.
    4. Finally create the service `s` by passing the required references and other parameters into its constructor.
       Note that this initializes the service's reference count to `1`.

    `start()` tracks the number of times a service is being used as a dependency.
    This is needed during shutdown.

3. The application runs.
   Services may call each other's methods.

4. _destroy_

    The `destroy()` is being called on the service layer.
    This currently happens when the custom component is removed from the DOM.

    Destruction reverses the process in `start()`.

    `destroyService(s)` is called for every service:

    1. Is the service already destroyed? Do nothing and return.
    2. Remove a reference from `s`.
       It is no longer used and can be safely destroyed if the count reaches zero.
    3. Call `destroyService(d)` for every dependency of `s`.
       It is important to destroy the dependencies _after_ the service has been destroyed,
       because the service's destructor may still reference its dependencies.

### Additional features

#### Disambiguate reference using a qualifier

The service layer implements 1-to-1 or 1-to-n dependencies.
This also means that an interface can be implemented by multiple services at the same time.

1-to-1 dependencies are the common case: a service references another single service that implements an interface.
The service layer throws an error when the reference cannot be resolved to an exact service.
The error conditions are:

- The interface is not implemented at all
- The interface is implemented multiple times but the reference is not qualified

A "qualifier" (a simple string tag in its current form) can be used to disambiguate the reference.

#### Referencing all services implementing an interface

Services can reference _all_ services implementing a certain interface.
This feature will most likely be used to implement extension points where a service may customize the implementation of another service.

When 1-to-n references are resolved, all services implementing the requested interface are gathered into an array which is then
injected into the service's constructor instead of the usual, single instance.

Verification (e.g. cycle detection) has been extended to support this feature.
Note that it is not an error if there are zero implementations of an interface: the array will simply be empty.

## Runtime lookups

The service layer provides an API to retrieve interface implementations at runtime (`getService` and `getServices`).
This is a required building block for the integration with react components: when a react component calls `useService(...)`,
a dynamic lookup will be triggered (the result can be cached).
An error will be thrown if the dependency on that service has not been declared in the package's metadata (`ui.references`).

## Limitations

### Cycles are forbidden

A service cannot depend on itself (directly or indirectly).
Such a thing would be impossible to implement (reasonably) because a dependency should be fully initialized
before it is being used.

We currently verify that there are no cycles through static analysis.
This should remain the default case: most references to other services should be static.
Tooling such as the `verifyDependencies` function can then provide useful analysis to prevent (or diagnose) common errors.

The restriction can still be relaxed when a service depends on itself statically but is only dynamically used once fully constructed;
in other words, if the cycle is "resolved" once the first service method is actually being called.

The way this could be implemented is by declaring a dependency as _lazy_.
A reference would still be injected into the service's constructor, but it will only be a proxy object that _must not_ be used in a cycle.
Such a reference cannot be verified statically and should therefore only be used at carefully chosen locations to break cycles.

Example:

```js
class MyService {
    constructor({ references }) {
        const actuallyMyself = references.myself; // not a MyService, but a Lazy<MyService>
        this.actuallyMyself = actuallyMyself;

        // Would throw because myself has not been fully constructed yet!
        actuallyMyself.get().foo();
    }

    bar() {
        // Works because by now the service has been constructed.
        // This requires runtime checks inside get().
        this.actuallyMyself.get().foo();
    }

    foo() {
        console.log("Hello World");
    }
}
```
