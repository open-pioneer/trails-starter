# Ways to patch a package

This document gives an overview over different techniques to change the behavior of an existing package.

## Introduction

It is sometimes necessary to modify a package in a project without the ability to trigger a release containing the desired changes.

Some possible reasons are:

- The package contains a bug and a release that includes the fix is not (yet) available
- An intended behavior change will not be accepted upstream but is required for the application to work
- The package is unmaintained

Before patching a package, consider working with the upstream maintainers and send them a feature request or ask them to include your intended behavior change as a contribution.
Patching a package increases your maintenance burden, since you're often modifying internal behavior:

- Updates may be more costly (or even impossible) because your changes need to be merged with the updated package
- Your changes may break randomly because the assumptions you made about the package's internals are no longer true

Even if you patched a package, it is good practice (and in your own interest) to attempt to contribute your changes anyway or
at least to open an issue describing the bug or needed feature.
A future version of the package that includes your changes would mean that you don't need to maintain your own version anymore.

With those risks in mind, choose one of the following alternatives, depending on your requirements.
When in doubt, choose the less powerful alternative, since it often comes with a smaller maintenance burden.

## Using methods of the trails framework

If the package you attempt to modify is a trails package, you have some builtin methods to achieve that.

### Properties

Package properties can be overwritten from an application.
For example:

```ts
// src/apps/your-app/app.ts
const Element = createCustomElement({
    component: AppUI,
    appMetadata,
    config: {
        properties: {
            // Overrides the `someProperty` property in "some-package-name"`
            "some-package-name": {
                someProperty: "new-value"
            }
        }
    }
});
```

For more details, see

- [How to use properties](./tutorials/HowToUseProperties.md)
- [Package reference](./reference/Package.md)

### I18n messages

Just like properties, an app can also overwrite the i18n messages used by other packages.
For example:

```yaml
# src/apps/your-app/i18n/en.yaml
messages:
    # ...

overrides:
    # Overrides `message.id` in "some-package-name"
    some-package-name:
        message.id: "Replacement message"
```

For more details, see the [I18N format reference](./reference/I18nFormat.md).

### Services

Services cannot be replaced directly at this time.
However, an app can forcefully disable services defined by another package.
Since references between services are not based on classes, but based on interface names, you can simply substitute your own implementation.

The following example replaces the `NotificationService` (from `@open-pioneer/notifier`), which usually displays Chakra toasts, with an implementation that simply logs the messages.

To disable the service:

```js
// src/apps/your-app/build.config.mjs
import { defineBuildConfig } from "@open-pioneer/build-support";

export default defineBuildConfig({
    i18n: ["en"],
    ui: {
        references: ["notifier.NotificationService"]
    },
    overrides: {
        // Package name
        "@open-pioneer/notifier": {
            services: {
                // Internal service name within the package.
                // Can be learned by inspecting the package's source code (or its compiled package.json).
                NotificationServiceImpl: {
                    // Completely removes the service from the application.
                    enabled: false
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

You can then implement a new version of the `NotificationService`, either in your app or in another package. To do this, it is necessary to implement exactly the same interface as the old service; the name of the service can be chosen freely.

Note that this replaces the `NotificationService` in the entire application, so all packages in that application
will observe your new implementation.
It is therefore important to provide an implementation that (roughly) conforms to the original API, to avoid runtime errors.

For this example, we can simply add a new service to our application:

```js
// src/apps/your-app/build.config.mjs
import { defineBuildConfig } from "@open-pioneer/build-support";

export default defineBuildConfig({
    services: {
        CustomNotificationService: {
            provides: "notifier.NotificationService"
        }
    }
    // ...
});
```

And here is the implementation (based on `@open-pioneer/notifier@0.3.4`).

```ts
export class CustomNotificationService {
    // This method will be called whenever anyone in the application uses the `NotificationService`
    // to emit a notification.
    notify(options: unknown) {
        console.log("Notification", options);
    }

    closeAll() {}

    // This method is an internal API used by the <Notifier /> component,
    // used to register a handler (listener) for incoming notifications.
    // If this method wouldn't exist, we would get a runtime error in the Notifier component.
    registerHandler() {
        return {
            destroy() {}
        };
    }
}
```

Besides implementing a complete new service, it is also possible to reuse the original service in your new code. For example, the original service can be wrapped or extended to adjust its functionality.
The original implementation can be retrieved by importing it from the patched package's service entry point.

See also the [Service reference](./reference/Services.md) for more details.

## Copying/forking a package

One simple way to modify an existing package is to copy it into your own source tree.
This can work well in some circumstances, for example if the package provides simple functions or classes (or React components).

You can simply use the copied package instead of the original one.
Note that you can use either the package's source code or the published package code from `node_modules`.
In both cases, make sure to conform to the package's license.
Keep in mind that you may have to modify your build configuration (Vite, Linter, TypeScript, etc.) to work with the package's code (or to ignore it).

This approach stops working when _other_ packages _also_ use that package and you want to modify _them_ as well.
For example, you can copy and modify the `@open-pioneer/runtime` all you want; other packages will still use the original version.
You need to use the package manager to achieve that (see below).

## Using the package manager

You can use pnpm to make complex changes to your packages.
pnpm's capabilities include:

- A workflow for simple patches to another package (by applying a patch/diff file).
  This is a great alternative if you only need to change a few lines of code.
- Changing a package's metadata, for example the `dependencies` or `peerDependencies`
- Overriding packages and their dependencies.
  You can change packages at will in your application's entire dependency graph.

All of those features are described in [pnpm's Documentation](https://pnpm.io/).
This section contains a few practical examples.

### Using `pnpm patch`

In this example, we're going to modify the `BasemapSwitcher`'s implementation to always render layer titles in upper case.

At the time of this writing, the current version of `@open-pioneer/basemap-switcher` is `0.4.2`.
To create a patch, simply call [pnpm patch](https://pnpm.io/cli/patch) from your terminal:

```
$ pnpm patch @open-pioneer/basemap-switcher
You can now edit the following folder: /tmp/f3661f760f6e544d6a19972fa9ed9132

Once you're done with your changes, run "pnpm patch-commit '/tmp/f3661f760f6e544d6a19972fa9ed9132'"
```

pnpm has created a temporary directory that contains the contents of `@open-pioneer/basemap-switcher`.
We can simply edit that directory, pnpm will track our changes.

In our case, we locate the label computation in the `useBasemapItem` hook in `BasemapSwitcher.js`:

```js
// BasemapSwitcher.js
function useBasemapItem(layer) {
    const intl = useIntl();
    const notAvailableLabel = intl.formatMessage({ id: "layerNotAvailable" });
    const label = useTitle(layer).toUpperCase(); // Patch: all labels in uppercase
    // ...
}
```

We change the label constant to always be uppercase and save the file.
Finally, we call `pnpm patch-commit`:

```bash
$ pnpm patch-commit '/tmp/f3661f760f6e544d6a19972fa9ed9132'
```

The result can be observed in the `map-sample` application:

![Map sample app with upper case basemap titles](./WaysToPatchAPackage_BasemapsUppercase.png)

#### How does it work?

pnpm computes the changes made by your edits and saves them as a patch:

```patch
# patches/@open-pioneer__basemap-switcher@0.4.2.patch
diff --git a/BasemapSwitcher.js b/BasemapSwitcher.js
index e1b45ef281a5a670a9137b85b0f0ea81c916776f..869e78329fcbf863199669508f1c7ab23a822dd8 100644
--- a/BasemapSwitcher.js
+++ b/BasemapSwitcher.js
@@ -115,7 +115,7 @@ function BasemapSelectValue(props) {
 function useBasemapItem(layer) {
   const intl = useIntl();
   const notAvailableLabel = intl.formatMessage({ id: "layerNotAvailable" });
-  const label = useTitle(layer);
+  const label = useTitle(layer).toUpperCase(); // Patch: all labels in uppercase
   const isAvailable = useLoadState(layer) !== "error";
   return {
     isAvailable,
```

It also creates a new entry in your `package.json`:

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "pnpm": {
        "patchedDependencies": {
            "@open-pioneer/basemap-switcher@0.4.2": "patches/@open-pioneer__basemap-switcher@0.4.2.patch"
        }
    }
}
```

Both changes should be committed to your project.
`pnpm install` will automatically apply the patch to the package whenever possible.
If that fails, for example if the package is updated and has diverged, pnpm will report an error.
You can then either re-implement the patch or drop it altogether.

Note that you can also "augment" your patch if you need to; simply re-execute `pnpm patch` for that package.

You can also use `pnpm patch` to change arbitrary files in a package (not only source code), for example you can change a package's metadata by editing the `package.json` file.

### Overriding a dependency

pnpm allows you to [override dependencies](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) using the `pnpm.override` object in your `package.json`.
Note that this feature can only be used in the _top level_ `package.json` file, i.e. the `package.json` file at the root of your repository.

The following example overrides all instances of a package with a different version of that package.
This can be used to force updates if the package contains a security vulnerability.
It can also be used to force a dependency to use the newer version, even if its original `package.json` only supports an older version.

```jsonc
// package.json
{
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "semver@<7.5.2": ">=7.5.2"
        }
    }
}
```

The following example only overrides a package version when used from _another_ package.
In this case, the `chakra-react-select` package used an old version of `react-select`; the new version expression made it pick up an update:

```jsonc
// package.json
{
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "chakra-react-select>react-select": "^5.8.0"
        }
    }
}
```

This feature can also be used to change a package altogether.
The following example replaces _all_ usages of the package `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec` with the (compatible) package `@maplibre/maplibre-gl-style-spec`:

```jsonc
// package.json
{
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "@mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec": "npm:@maplibre/maplibre-gl-style-spec@^20.1.1"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that you can also use other protocols than `npm`, for example `file` or `git`.

Finally, you can also substitute a local package:

```jsonc
{
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "some-package-name": "workspace:your-local-package@*"
        }
    }
}
```

Some versions of pnpm may report dependency issues when overriding a local package, for example:

```text
✕ unmet peer some-package-name@your-local-package@*: found x.y.z
```

In that case, you can also relax the [peer dependency rules](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmpeerdependencyrulesallowedversions) by overriding them:

```jsonc
{
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "some-package-name": "workspace:your-local-package@*"
        },
        "peerDependencyRules": {
            "allowedVersions": {
                // '*' is the most permissive, which is fine in this case
                // since we've completely replaced the package with our version anyway.
                "some-package-name": "*"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Walkthrough: forking a package and building it yourself

In this walkthrough, we will fork an existing package, extend it and build it ourselves to test the changes.
This can be helpful if you intend to contribute a new feature or fix a bug to some upstream package, but need to use the changed version in your application immediately.

Fist, fork the source repository (or create a branch in the original repository) and make your changes.
In this example, we will make a very simple change the `@open-pioneer/basemap-switcher` package ([v0.11.0](https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-openlayers-base-packages/tree/%40open-pioneer/basemap-switcher%400.11.0/src/packages/basemap-switcher)).

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/my-basemap-switcher-changes
Switched to a new branch 'feature/my-basemap-switcher-changes'
```

We update the `BasemapItem` component to render all labels in upper case:

```diff
function BasemapItem(props: { item: SelectOption }) {
    const intl = useIntl();
    const notAvailableLabel = intl.formatMessage({ id: "layerNotAvailable" });
    const item = props.item;
    return (
        <Select.Item
            item={item}
            key={item.value}
            justifyContent="flex-start"
            // Override pointer-events: none rule for disabled items; we want to show the tooltip on hover
            pointerEvents="auto"
            className="basemap-switcher-option"
        >
-           {item.label}
+           {item.label.toUpperCase()}
```

Then (not shown), you can commit your changes and initiate a pull request to the source repository.

To try the changed package in your own application, you can build the package yourself.
Trails packages typically use a `build` script in their `package.json` file.
The script builds the package and places the output into the `dist` directory:

```bash
$ cd src/packages/basemap-switcher
$ pnpm build
```

Next, we can simulate "publishing" the package by running `pnpm pack`:

```bash
$ pnpm pack
...
/path/to/project/trails-openlayers-base-packages/src/packages/basemap-switcher/dist/open-pioneer-basemap-switcher-0.11.0.tgz
```

`pnpm pack` creates a tarball that contains the build package.
This is the format that you would download via your package manager when installing a package from `npmjs.com`.

Next, you can copy the tar file to your project (for example, into the `patches` directory) and override
the existing basemap switcher package:

```jsonc
// top level package.json
{
    // ...
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "@open-pioneer/basemap-switcher": "file:./patches/open-pioneer-basemap-switcher-0.11.0.tgz"
        }
    }
}
```

Run `pnpm install` to apply the changes, then run `pnpm dev`.
The application will now use the modified version of the package:

![Map sample app with upper case basemap titles](./WaysToPatchAPackage_BasemapsUppercase_TarballOverride.png)

##### Notes:

- The override replaces the package in your entire application.
  This works best if the modified version of the package is close to (or compatible with) the original version.
- You can commit the tarball to your git repository.
  Other developers will automatically apply the override when they run `pnpm install`.
- PNPM will currently not detect changes (file modifications) in the tarball itself.
  If you need to update it, simply change the file name as well.
- This process can also be used for multiple packages:
    ```bash
    # Runs pack on every package and places the output into the specified directory.
    $ pnpm recursive pack --filter='@open-pioneer/*' --pack-destination=/path/to/output/directory
    ```
    However, this may become too cumbersome in the long run.
    If you need custom development versions of trails packages, you can also contact the maintenance team to publish a custom development snapshot.

#### Walkthrough: replacing @open-pioneer/runtime

In this short walkthrough, we will replace the package `@open-pioneer/runtime` with our own custom version.
We will add a simple log message to the application start to demonstrate the replacement.

To get started, copy the contents of `@open-pioneer/runtime` into a local package in your source directory, e.g. to `src/packages/custom-runtime`.
Either the source code version (from [here](https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-core-packages/tree/main/src/packages/runtime)) or the built sources (from `node_modules`) will work.

To indicate that the package has been modified, we simply change the version a bit:

```jsonc
// src/packages/custom-runtime/package.json
{
    "name": "@open-pioneer/runtime",
    "version": "2.1.5-custom.0"
    // ...
}
```

Now we make our change: we are basing this walkthrough on version `2.1.5`, so we have to edit `CustomElement.js`:

```js
// src/packages/custom-runtime/CustomElement.js
// ...
class PioneerApplication extends HTMLElement {
    // ...
    connectedCallback() {
        LOG.debug("Launching application");
        console.log("Custom log message during application start"); // Our change
        // ...
    }
}
```

Next, we override the package `@open-pioneer/runtime` with our local version for _all_ packages in our applications:

```jsonc
// top level package.json
{
    // ...
    "pnpm": {
        "overrides": {
            "@open-pioneer/runtime": "workspace:*"
        },
        "peerDependencyRules": {
            "allowedVersions": {
                "@open-pioneer/runtime": "*"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

After editing the `package.json` file, execute `pnpm install`.
You can already verify that the changes have been applied: open an application or package
that uses `@open-pioneer/runtime` and inspect the `node_modules`.
You will see that it now uses the custom version.

Running an app (both in development or production) will now print the new message into the console:

![An additional message is printed to the console](./WaysToPatchAPackage_RuntimeLogMessage.png)

NOTE:

- When you're patching a built package, it is probably best to remove source maps for files that you have edited.
  These can be misleading, since they reflect the _old_ content of the file.
  Source maps are either located at the end of the file (as a comment) or as a separate `.map` file.
- You may have to adjust your TypeScript or ESLint rules (e.g. update `.eslintignore` to ignore the patched package).
- When copying a built package into the source directory, our Vite plugin will print a warning:

    ```text
    [vite] warning: Using framework metadata from package.json instead of build.config.mjs in /home/michael/projects/pioneer/starter/src/packages/custom-runtime, make sure that this intended.
    ```

    You can safely ignore this warning if it is expected (which is the case here).
    The warning is printed because this circumstance may also hint at a configuration problem.

- When you're patching another package in its source form (e.g. by copying it from its source repository), you might have to fix up its dependencies.
  These might use the `workspace:...` protocol, and those packages are not available locally (just use real versions instead).
- When you're replacing a trails package, don't change the `name` in its `package.json` file: it is currently significant for the registration of services.
  However, you can freely change the `version` or the directory name.
- All of this should be considered a hack.
  Use this technique only when no other options are available to you.
