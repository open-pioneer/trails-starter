# Changelog

## 2024-07-24

-   Improve the commit hooks (`.husky/pre-commit`).
    Commit hooks run during `git commit` to check the code style and run tests.
    Previously, all files within the project were checked for style issues and all unit tests were run.

    With this update, only changed files will be checked (via [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)) and only tests affected by changed files will be re-executed (via `vitest --changed`).
    Also, prettier will now format staged files automatically -- it is no longer necessary to run `prettier` manually in most cases.

    This change significantly improves the time it takes to commit a change.
    Unfortunately, TypeScript will still run type checks on the entire code base.

-   Update `syncpack`.

## 2024-07-23

-   Update the license report script. It can now handle dependency license information returned by pnpm 9.
    See also <https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-openlayers-base-packages/pull/335>.
-   Configure `virtual-store-dir-max-length=60` in `.npmrc`.

    This limits the paths generated by `pnpm` to the given length, which helps on windows where "long" paths can trigger weird errors.
    See also <https://pnpm.io/npmrc#virtual-store-dir-max-length> for more information.

-   Update the patch against `react-select`.
-   Update development dependencies.

## 2024-07-04

-   `tsconfig.json`: Switch to `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"`.
    This is the appropriate resolution mode for TypeScript code when using a bundler such as Vite.

    `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` fixes some cases where the TypeScript compiler would not find the declarations for certain modern packages
    (e.g. those that only use `exports` in their package.json).

-   Update workflow files (some actions were outdated).

## 2024-06-24

-   Update trails dependencies.

    It appears that recent versions of pnpm will sometimes not update peer dependencies when using `pnpm update` (https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8081).
    This mostly seems to affect _indirectly_ required packages which are not explicitly listed in a `package.json` file.

    This may produce errors such as this:

    ```text
    ERR_PNPM_PEER_DEP_ISSUES  Unmet peer dependencies

    src/packages/sample-package
    └─┬ @open-pioneer/runtime 2.1.5
    ├── ✕ unmet peer @open-pioneer/base-theme@^0.3.2: found 0.3.1
    └── ✕ unmet peer @open-pioneer/runtime-react-support@^1.0.2: found 1.0.1
    ```

    As a workaround, you can temporarily (or even permanently) list the packages and their desired version in a `package.json`, and then execute `pnpm update-shared-versions && pnpm install && pnpm dedupe`.

    For example:

    ```jsonc
    // top level package.json
    {
        // ...
        "dependencies": {
            // ...
            "@open-pioneer/base-theme": "^0.3.2",
            "@open-pioneer/runtime-react-support": "^1.0.2",
            "@open-pioneer/react-utils": "^0.2.3",
            "@open-pioneer/http": "^2.1.7"
        }
    }
    ```

-   Update `react` to 18.3.1
-   Update `ol` to 9.2.4
-   Update test packages:

    -   "@testing-library/dom": "^10.2.0",
    -   "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.6",
    -   "@testing-library/react": "^16.0.0",

    These versions resolve a deprecation warning with the new versions of react ("Warning: `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` is deprecated in favor of `React.act` ...").

    They require patching the dependency declarations of `@open-pioneer/test-utils` to get rid of warnings, since there is no new release yet that declares compatibility
    with the new major versions (although they will work in practice):

    ```jsonc
    // package.json
    {
        "pnpm": {
            "peerDependencyRules": {
                "allowedVersions": {
                    "@open-pioneer/test-utils>@testing-library/react": ">= 14.1.2",
                    "@open-pioneer/test-utils>@testing-library/dom": ">= 9.3.3"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## 2024-06-17

-   Update patch for `react-select`: only use valid values for `aria-activedescendant`.
    This removes a warning in firefox when `aria-activedescendant` was set to an empty string.

## 2024-05-14

-   Update to Vite 5.1 and Vitest 1.6
    -   Major changes in Vitest 1: [Release Notes](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
    -   Major changes in Vite 5: [Release Notes](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5)

## 2024-05-10

-   Require pnpm >= 9.0, see [release notes](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.0).
    This also updates the lockfile to `lockfileVersion: 9.0`
-   Configure `envDir: __dirname` in `vite.config.ts` to load `.env` files from the root of the repository instead of `src`.

## 2024-03-14

-   Update to latest Open Pioneer Trails packages
-   Update to OpenLayers 9
