## Quick start

Ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 20 or later) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Version 10.x) installed.

Then execute the following commands to get started:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-starter.git # Clone the repository
$ cd trails-starter
$ pnpm install                                                 # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run dev                                                 # Launch development server
```

Vite will print the project's local address (usually <http://localhost:5173/>).
Point your browser at it and start programming!

Additional in-depth information can be found in the [Documentation](./docs/README.md).
